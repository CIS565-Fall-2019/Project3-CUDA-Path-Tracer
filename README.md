### What is Path Tracer and how it is different from Ray Tracing?

Path tracing is a realistic lighting algorithm that simulates light bouncing around a scene. it is based on Monte-Carlo based sampling technique and simulate realistic images through rendering. The path tracer is continually rendering, so the scene will start off grainy and become smoother over time. 

The following features are enabled in the path tracer:
